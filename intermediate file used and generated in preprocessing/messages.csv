I have explained current market situation in detail which can help you in taking further actions

For now guys i will say :

1 - there are few tensions in market like 
(Fed interest rate hike, ukraine war tension) so these tensions are temporary which do not come easily so benifit from these and pick good fundamental companies for investing.

2 - market can take 2-4 months to price in these situation and then move upwards. 

3- its better to pick good fundamental companies from midcap and smallcap to have higher return.

4- if someone wants to invest in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency then you cam invest 30-50% of amount in next 2-3 weeks and rest 50% you can add if it comes near 20k level"

This is the way which market usually do when alot of new investors come by seeing gains.

6- No doubt market was too much overvalued so this is the correction time going on and for me it is accumulation time.

Inflation is caused by the failure of aggregate supply to equal the increase in aggregate demand. Inflation can, therefore, be controlled by increasing the supplies of goods and services and reducing money incomes in order to control aggregate demand.

#inflation"
2554,2022-05-24," There are a variety of tools to control inflation including:

Monetary policy – Higher interest rates reduce demand in the economy, leading to lower economic growth and lower inflation.

Control of money supply – Monetarists argue there is a close link between the money supply and inflation, therefore controlling money supply can control inflation.

Supply-side policies – policies to increase the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy, putting downward pressure on long-term costs.

Fiscal policy – a higher rate of income tax could reduce spending, demand and inflationary pressures.

Wage controls – trying to control wages could, in theory, help to reduce inflationary pressures. However, apart from the 1970s, it has been rarely used."
