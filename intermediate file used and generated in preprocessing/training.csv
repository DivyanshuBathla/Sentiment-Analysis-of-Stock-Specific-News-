Monetary policy – Higher interest rates reduce demand in the economy, leading to lower economic growth and lower inflation.

Supply-side policies – policies to increase the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy, putting downward pressure on long-term costs.

Fiscal policy – a higher rate of income tax could reduce spending, demand and inflationary pressures.

Wage controls – trying to control wages could, in theory, help to reduce inflationary pressures.
